# SGApps Server

A network solution for web applications.

>>>
Since this application is fully compatible with nodejs-mvc, I decided to replace nodejs-mvc with this new approach.

SGApps Server is completely new solution, that will be improved continuously thats why I will work on this project instead of nodejs-mvc
